# INTRODUCTION
This project explores the macroevolutionary spatial trends accross 
primates. Given the extent of this project, the first analysis looks only 
at Miocene apes as an exploratory analysis. The file, initial_raw_data, 
contains information for all primates and will be used in later analyses.
