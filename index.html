              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This is a map showing proportion of low access to grocery store access within Rock County, WI. The darkest areas are in the middle and bottom middle of the map and these areas coincide with the cities of Beloit and Janesville. Given that these are urban areas, it makes sense that these areas also have the highest proportions of individuals with easy access to grocery stores. Interestingly, some of the areas in the cities as well as surrounding the cities have the lowest proportion of access. The areas on the border of this county (not including the Beloit region located on the bottom middle) are typically more rural areas. These areas occupy the middle class of access to a supermarket, indicating some limitations to access but not as limited as those immediately surrounding the more urban spaces. The limited access to grocery stores in the areas surrounding the cities indicates to me that, possibly, these areas rely on the cities for grocery store access and may not have their own grocery stores perhaps to a greater degree than the more rural areas on the edges of the county which have moderate access.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This is a map showing proportion of low access to grocery store access within Rock County, WI. Many of the circles within this map appear to be quite large, indicating many individuals are in close proximity to a grocery store. Interestingly, theres two primary clusters which are near Janesville and Beloit, which are the largest urban areas. Given that these areas contain both the largest and smallest circles, I think this indicates that grocery stores are perhaps more clustered in specific areas, rather than dispersed throughout these regions, leading to the disparity of access in urban areas. The fact that these perimeter counties have large circles was initially not intuitive as they counties are more rural, however, when thinking about this, I did consider that, while these areas are rural, they are made up of many small towns that have at least one grocery store. Perhaps this result indicates that even rural citizens live close to their small towns and, as a result, also their grocery store. The more remote land far from these small towns may be mostly farmland and less inhabited.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This interpretation references the colors observed in the PuOr color scheme. There are two larger cities within Rock County which include Janesville (located near the middle of the map) and Beloit (located near the bottom middle of the map). There are also smaller towns scattered throughout the county. One of the interesting components to this map is the smaller areas located in the Janesville, WI region. Interestingly, there appears to be some parts of this region that are predominately grocery stores with very low population density (denoted by the dark, more pure purple) and, likewise, there's areas with a higher population density with low grocery store access (denoted by the lighter yellow). To me, this indicates that, in the Janesville area, there's certain parts of Janesville which are mostly urban/shopping/grocery, while other parts of Janesville are more exclusively residential. The areas on the border of the map which are a dark, rich purple, I suspect, must be quite rural with a few small towns that contain a grocery store that many people in these rural areas live around. However, there are also some medium brown regions along the border, which indicate high density and moderate grocery store access. It is likely that these areas contain larger towns, but are still moderately rural. Rock county has some moderately sized cities and some large towns, but is also very rural. This map seems to emphasis this mix of more urban and rural through the exploration of both grocery access and population density and its high variability within the county.</p>
