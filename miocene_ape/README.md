# INTRODUCTION
This project explores the spatial dispersion of Miocene Apes. The initial data was procurred from the supplemental materials of Urciuoli and Alba's "Systematics of Miocene apes: State of the art of a neverending controversy." The raw data file downloaded from supplements was renamed raw_ape_data.xlsx. 

This file was imported into R to make the data usable.
