# INTRODUCTION	
This project looks at overall spatial trends in primate evolution. 

# METHODS
On March 3rd, 2023, data was downloaded from https://paleobiodb.org/#/. 
There were two downloaded spreadsheets: one focused on specimens and 
another focused on taxa. The specimen download contained some GIS 
information, primarily regarding specimens found in the U.S., which was 
why both were downloaded. These spreadsheets were imported into R to be 
cleaned.
