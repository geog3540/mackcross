NOTES: 
If there are lots of file on your server, how does serve know which to 
pull first? It always looks for index.html first. It must be there to 
create a website. 

This is how to start the index.html file: 
<1DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>

The two htmls are opening and closing tags respectively. Website goes in 
between html tag 


This is how you create a comment: 
<!-- This is just like a comment!!-->

The head part of html is about the document, such as info about the 
document; body is for the rest 


LOCAL SERVERS
You don't want to constantly push every little thing then wait for it to 
load in github pages to check--there could be little bugs in it etc. The 
solution to this is python. 

How to get python? (19:47)
