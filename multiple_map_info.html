		    This map considers connections between educational resource 
			investment (as measured through variables such as spending 
			per student) and measures of student success (as measured
			through variables such as ACT science scores and graduation
			rate within 4 years. 
			
			The spatial patterns can be viewed from classes ranging in size
			from 3-7 classes. When using the quantile classification, 
			unfortunately, the disparity of population density between Iowa
			counties is masked, with less densely populated areas placed in 
			the same class as the more rare, urban spaces such as Des Moines. 
			While for some projects, this may not be an issue, however, given 
			that the purpose of this work is to show how investment in education
			may be tied to population density, this classification fails by 
			grouping non-urban spaces into more urban areas, as the quantile 
			classification requires an equal number of features in each class
			regardless of their similarity or dissimilarity. This can be 
			somewhat mediated by selecting more classes, however, note that
			even with seven classes, the final class in the population 
			density map is 76-890, while all other classes have a much 
			smaller range. Given this obscurity, its difficult to draw
			meaningful comparisons between population density and the other
			variables, especially considering the other variables are not 
			nearly as diverse in their values.
			
			The equal interval classification is interesting. In terms of 
			population density, this map performs better than quantile 
			in terms of depicting the disparity of rural versus urban 
			spaces. Although, the color scheme fails as, depending on the 
			number of classes, it can be difficult to differentiate between
			colors since they are so sparse. In terms of the other variables, 
			it seems that generally counties do not struggle to have students
			graduate, although the more eastern counties are lighter than 
			the rest of the counties, indicating less graduates. Although, 
			I had anticipated seeing a pattern of more urban spaces investing
			more in their students, this pattern was not present in the 
			equal interval classification. There was not a clear pattern 
			in ACT scores. However, this classification also has downsides,
			including, for instance, that two counties which share the same 
			value may be in different classes--for instance, Lee County in 
			the Percentage of Student Graduates map has a value of 88, while Wright
			County also has a value of 88, yet both are in different classes. 
			This also creates a false visual, as counties of the same value
			should be in the same class. 
			
			Lastly, with the natural breaks classification, these maps can
			only be evaluated individually, as this classification is not 
			conducive to comparison as they each follow different break
			structures. Individually, the maps do seem to better show the
			underlying spatial structure of the data, as values dissimilar 
			values are not forced together into the same class. Again, the 
			ACT scores do not seem to have a clear spatial pattern. It is 
			possible that only students who are planning to go to college
			take the ACT score and, as a result, they may not be great indicators
			of student success. Another element which became evident when
			viewing the maps was that one of the counties that spends the 
			most on their students (Van Buren) does not have associated ACT
			score values (NaN), which is unfortunate in evaluating trends
			of investment and measures of student success. Again, however, 
			this classification is not supposed to be used to compare against
			each other, but it did make some of the individual patterns
